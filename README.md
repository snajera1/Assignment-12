## Getting Started

This is a simple java program that checks if a password inputted by the user meets the requirements of being 8-16 characters long
and meets three of the following four requirements:
-Has an uppercase letter
-Has a lowercase letter
-Has a special character
-Has a number
If it does not meet the requirements, it prints a warning to the user with the requirements they failed to meet. If it meets the requirements,
the user is given confirmation.
